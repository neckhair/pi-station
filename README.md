# PiStation

PiStation is a cli to read values from somewhere and put it to somewhere in a specific format. This is handy
to implement a customer weather station on a RaspberryPi. The original idea is to read temperature data from
a serial port or a webservice and put them into an elasticsearch instance.

This gem is work in progress and not ready yet.
